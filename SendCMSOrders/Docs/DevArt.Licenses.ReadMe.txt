Embedding licensing for 

   Devart.Data.MySql into Project (.dll)
   
Note:
   Embedding into project with this method
   will permit compiling at other workstations or BuildServer 
   without needing to have the DevArt product installed

   However, this procedure must be performed any time the 
   DevArt product changes by version number

1. Exclude from project the licenses.licx files (usually in properties folder)

2. Compile license into any .exe/.dll that uses driver

   a. create licenses.licx in project root

      add contents: Devart.Data.MySql.MySqlConnection, Devart.Data.MySql

   b. copy microsoft lc.exe (licensing compiler) into project root

      run command to create compiled license file

         lc.exe /target:SendToCMS.exe /complist:licenses.licx /i:bin\debug\Devart.Data.MySql.dll /v
         
         outputs: SendToCMS.exe.licenses
         
   c. include SendToCMS.exe.licenses in Project with properties

      Build Action             : Embedded Resource
      Copy to Output Directory : Do not copy
